# CMake SFML Project Template

This repository template, should allow for a fast and hassle-free kick start of your next SFML project using CMake.  
Thanks to [GitHub's nature of templates](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), you can fork this repository without inheriting its Git history.

The template starts out very basic, but might receive additional features over time:

- Basic CMake script to build your project and link SFML
- Support for linking SFML statically or as shared library
- Support for linking the C runtime statically
- Basic [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) script for all major platforms
